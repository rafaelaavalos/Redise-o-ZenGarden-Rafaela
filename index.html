	This xhtml document is marked up to provide the designer with the maximum possible flexibility.
	There are more classes and extraneous tags than needed, and in a real world situation, it's more
	likely that it would be much leaner.
	
	However, I think we can all agree that even given that, we're still better off than if this had been
	built with tables.

            <p class="p3">so what is this about?</p>
            <p class="p4">There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.</p>
            <p class="p4">CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>
